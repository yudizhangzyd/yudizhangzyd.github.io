### Clustering Categorical Dataset

- Joint work with Dr. [Karin Dorman](https://www.stat.iastate.edu/people/karin-dorman). Adapt existing methods to categorical dataset clustering by taking the confidence information of that dataset, which is faster than other existing methods. We created an R package [**CClust**](https://yudizhangzyd.github.io/CClust/index.html) for our methods.
